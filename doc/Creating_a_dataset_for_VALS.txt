Creating and loading a new dataset

A dataset consists of the images, object boundaries and extracted features. For the GBM dataset, this consistes of the whole slide image, cell boundaries and histological features. Scripts specific to the dataset need to be created since the extracted features and boundaries may not be provided in the same format. 


Whole slide images:

The images will be handled on the IIPImage server. This requires them to be formatted in a multi-resolution 'pyramid'. Vips is used to do the conversion. The pyramid files are located in /fastdata/pyramids on turing, The path to the image is saved in the database. VALS uses the database to get the path when forming a request for the IIPIMage server.





Boundaries:

Scripts are available to create a file suitable for importing into Mysql via the 'INFILE' command. 

To load the boundaries into the database use the following:

Login:
	mysql -u <User Name> -p --local-infile=1 boundary
	
Load the data:
	LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ‘filename in quotes’ INTO TABLE boundaries fields terminated by ‘\t’ lines terminated by ‘\n’ (slide, centroid_x, centroid_y, boundary);





Features:

Tools have been written to extract the features from the segmentation pipeline output. Currently there is a script for each slide type (GBM, SOX2) because the number of features is hard coded. (Needs to be generalized to determine # of features from the file)
The scripts require a particular directory structure. 

slides
	|
	----TCGA-08-0520-01Z-00-DX1			<-- slide name
	|	|
	|	----- <segmentation files> 1 for each tile of this slide
	|
	|
	----TCGA-14-0787-01Z-00-DX1			<-- slide name
		|
		----- <segmentation files> 1 for each tile of this slide
		
		
	
Tables to be updated in the database:

Importing the boundaries will update the boundaries table. The slides table will need an entry for each slide imported. Since datasets can be made up of 1 or many slides, they are handled separately.	The tables 'datasets' and 'dataset_slides' also need to be updated for the specific dataset. This is shown in the following. 



Adding images to the database:

To create a .csv file for import int the database, use the following command:

	genlist <image dir> <image list> <outfile>
	
<image dir> should be the directory that contains the images to import. <image list> is a csv file that contains the slide name and scale. Use the following command to add the images to the database.

	LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE ‘filename in quotes’ INTO TABLE slides fields terminated by ‘,’ lines terminated by ‘\n’ (name, x_size, y_size, pyramid_path, scale);




Creating a dataset:

Run the following to create the dataset in the database:

	create_dataset.py <msql user name> <dataset name>  <features file relative to al_server data_path> <slide list>
